                    Hong Kong exists as an administrative region in China. 
                    On July 1, 1997 Britain returned Hong Kong to China and 
                    the region’s relationship with China was established as 
                    “one country, two systems”. Hong Kong had been a part of 
                    China for over 2000 years since the Qin Dynasty in the third 
                    century BCE. In the other half of the 19th century Britain had begun 
                    to seize control of regions we today associate with 
                    Hong Kong such as the Hong Kong Island, The Kowloon Peninsula 
                    and The New Territories.

                    The British Empire signed, together with China, on July 1, 1898, 
                    the Second Convention of Peking, which meant Britain was 
                    to lease the regions between Boundary Street and Shenzhen River. 
                    This lease was to expire on the first of July in 1997, 99 years 
                    after the lease was signed.

                    As the expiration day for the lease came closer Britain 
                    decided in 1982 to negotiate the transition of the leased region. 
                    This further led to Britain deciding to return the Kowloon Peninsula 
                    and the Hong Kong Island to China. In the declaration it was 
                    stated that Hong Kong was to become a part of China, but operate 
                    with the “current social and economic systems”, thus creating 
                    the “one country, two systems” phrase.
