        <h2>Chinese New Year</h2>
        <div>
          <p class="trads-p">
            The Lunar New Year is a 15 day festival beginning with the first new
            moon between the 21st of January and the 20th of February. One of
            the most popular events during the new year celebrations in Hong
            Kong is the New Year Parade where you can see things from lung
            dragons to traditional Chinese dancers. The parade starts at 8pm and
            goes from Nathan Road to Salisbury Road to Canton Road and finally
            to Haiphong Road. Unique to Hong Kong new years celebrations is
            horse racing. The Sha Tin Racecourse is usually filled with around
            one hundred thousand spectators during these events. The Hong Kong
            Jockey Club also organises a program of cultural festivities and
            entertainment. The Spring Lantern Festival marks the end of the
            Chinese New Year. The whole city is decorated with colourful
            lanterns and a carnival is held at the Hong Kong Cultural Centre
            Piazza where you can see impressive lantern displays as well as
            other performances like dancing and acrobatics.

        <h2>Tin Hau Festival</h2>
        <p>
          The Chinese sea goddess Tin Hau has historically been one of the most
          important gods in Hong Kong. As such, her birthday is accompanied by a
          grand celebration. While there are many different celebrations around
          the area the biggest one is in Cha Kwo Ling where people will parade
          down the streets, some may also dress up as mythological creatures
          like dragons or qilins and perform traditional dances.
